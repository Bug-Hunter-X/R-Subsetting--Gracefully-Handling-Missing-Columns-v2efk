This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in R when subsetting data frames.  The `bug.r` file shows code that attempts to select columns that may not exist.  This leads to an error. The `bugSolution.r` file provides a robust solution using the `%in%` operator and error handling to manage this situation gracefully. The example uses a simple data frame, but the principles apply to larger, more complex datasets.
